# Connect 4

In this assignment, we delve into implementing a charming and straightforward game called "Connect 4" using numpy arrays.

If you're unfamiliar with Connect 4, we recommend checking out [this link](https://www.gamesver.com/the-rules-of-connect-4-according-to-m-bradley-hasbro/) to learn about its rules. Additionally, you can experience the game firsthand by visiting [this link](https://boardgames.io/en/connect4).

After you've become familiar with the game, it's time to start your implementation. Begin by creating a 5x5 grid for the game and start implementing its rules and logic.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is not our goal in this assignment and doesn't earn any extra marks.

**Need More Challenge?**
You can implement single-player mode using the minimax algorithm.
